# Rapid-Mail
This is a Java Application created to simplify sendinng grades to multiple students. Having all of their information stored on a spreadsheet, this application, extracts the email ids, marks, etc, and sends it to the respective students.
Used Java Mail API, Apache POI API to interact with spreadsheet values(csv), and Java Swing for the GUI.
The code for this apppication was written in early 2021 and has not been upated since, issues might be faced when trying to send emails as many email services have updated their security policies(depends on service used).
Please do look at the code, as it did do the job excellently before:)
