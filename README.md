# Rapid-Mail
This is a Java Application created to simplify sending grades to multiple students. Having all of their information stored on a spreadsheet, this application, extracts the email ids, marks, etc, and sends it to the respective students.
## How it works
Used Java Mail API for sending emails, Apache POI API to interact with spreadsheet values(CSV), and Java Swing for the GUI.
### *
The code for this application was written in early 2021 and has not been updated since, issues might be faced when trying to send emails as many email services have updated their security policies(depending on the service used).
Please do look at the code, as it did do an excellent job:)
